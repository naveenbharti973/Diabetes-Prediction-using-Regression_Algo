# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning By using Regression Algo


Here's a sample README.md for a project titled "Diabetes Prediction using Regression." This project uses regression techniques to predict whether a person is diabetic or not, based on training and testing accuracy.

Diabetes Prediction using Regression
Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not using regression techniques. The dataset used includes various health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc. A regression model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated on its ability to predict diabetes.


Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

Glucose Level,  
Blood Pressure,  
Skin Thickness,    
Insulin Level,    
BMI,  
Age,  
Outcome (Diabetic: 1, Non-diabetic: 0)

Dependencies  
Python 3.x  
NumPy  
Pandas  
Scikit-learn  
Matplotlib (for visualizations, optional)

Project Steps

Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and normalize the data.

Feature Selection: Select important features for prediction.

Model Training: Use linear or logistic regression to train the model on the dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using training and testing data to measure accuracy.

Training and Testing

After splitting the data into training and testing sets, we applied regression to predict the outcome (whether a person is diabetic or not). The model is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Training Accuracy:

Accuracy: X%  
Precision: X%  
Recall: X%  

Testing Accuracy:  
Accuracy: X%  
Precision: X%  
Recall: X%  

Conclusion :
This project demonstrates the use of regression techniques for binary classification tasks like predicting diabetes. Further improvements can be made by testing other models or optimizing hyperparameters.
